- Understand the difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
- See the problems with simply relying on setState().
- Learn about the concept of Prop Drilling.
- Examine various popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
- Learn about the List Builder.
- Use the Flutter BottomSheet Widget.
- Learn to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
- Learn about design patterns and why they are useful.
- Understand how the Provider package works and use it to manage app state.






## Getting Started

1. **Create a Flutter Project**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the following command to create a new Flutter project (replace `my_app` with your desired project name):
     ```
     $ flutter create my_app
     ```
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```
     $ cd my_app
     ```

2. **Analyze Your Code**:
   - To analyze your Dart source code, run:
     ```
     $ flutter analyze
     ```

3. **Test Your App**:
   - To run tests for your project, execute:
     ```
     $ flutter test
     ```

4. **Run Your App**:
   - To run your app in debug mode on an active emulator or physical Android device, use:
     ```
     $ flutter run
     ```
     (Note: Debug mode may be slower.)
   - For release mode (better performance), run:
     ```
     $ flutter run --release
     ```

5. **View All Available Commands**:
   - To see all commands supported by Flutter, use:
     ```
     $ flutter --help --verbose
     ```

6. **Get the Current Flutter SDK Version**:
   - To check your Flutter SDK version, including framework, engine, and tools:
     ```
     $ flutter --version
     ```

Remember, you can explore more commands and options by using `flutter help <command>`
